## Introduction

This project is a part of the ALX SE curriculum and is an opportunity for you to enhance your programming skills, specifically in C, while gaining a deeper understanding of how a shell works. Your success in this project will depend on your ability to write clean, efficient code and your commitment to learning without resorting to copying or cheating.

## Project Overview

The Simple Shell project is a command-line interpreter that emulates the behavior of a basic Unix shell. It accepts user commands, executes them, and provides a prompt for further commands. The project will evolve through a series of tasks, starting with the most basic functionality and gradually incorporating more advanced features.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:
- Understand the basics of programming.
- Master the fundamentals of the C programming language.
- Develop a mindset of thinking like an engineer.
- Collaborate effectively in a group work setting.
- Learn how to learn independently and effectively.

## Requirements

Before you begin working on the Simple Shell project, make sure you understand and adhere to the following requirements:
- Use one of the allowed text editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compile your code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the provided compilation options.
- Follow the Betty style for writing code.
- Ensure your shell does not have memory leaks.
- Use system calls only when necessary.
- Create a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
- Include an AUTHORS file listing all contributors.
- Maintain a GitHub repository for your project (one repository per group).
- Produce the same output and error messages as the /bin/sh shell.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Simple Shell project, review the provided [framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559), which outlines the project's structure and expectations. Familiarize yourself with the required knowledge and resources, such as the Unix shell, Thompson shell, and related concepts.

## Usage

To use your Simple Shell, you will interact with it through the command line. The shell will provide a prompt where you can enter commands, which it will execute. You can also provide a file containing commands as input.

## Project Tasks

The Simple Shell project consists of a series of tasks, starting from the most basic functionality and progressing to more advanced features. Each task builds upon the previous one and contributes to the overall functionality of the shell.

## Advanced Features

In addition to the mandatory tasks, the project offers advanced features that challenge your skills even further. These features include handling aliases, variable replacement, comments, and more.

## Contributors

This project is a collaborative effort, and the success of your Simple Shell relies on the dedication and contributions of all team members. Make sure to acknowledge and document the contributions of each team member in the AUTHORS file.
